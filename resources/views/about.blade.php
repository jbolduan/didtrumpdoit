<span class="h1">About</span>

<p class="mt-4">This website is to track all the promises made by Donald Trump, Republican politicians, and conservative influencers. 
                The intention is to identify what was followed through on, what was not, and what was an outright lie. 
                This is a collaborative effort and you can participate by using the <a href="https://github.com/jbolduan/didtrumpdoit">GitHub repository</a> 
                either directly by contributing changes to code base or through opening issues/discussions to have others add or update items.</p>

<p class="mt-4">This site was created by the <a href="https://destiny.gg">destiny.gg</a> community.</p>

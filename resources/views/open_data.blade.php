<p>We are committed to open data, at this time we're transitioning from our old 
    <a href="https://github.com/jbolduan/didtrumpdoit.com">GitHub repository</a> 
    to a new web app built specifically to handle statement tracking. During this 
    time there will not be an updated data feed however we're committed to bringing 
    it back for anyone who would like to pull the data from this site.</p>
